## General Information
- This project explores the given dataset to idenify driving factors for Loan Defaulters
- Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.
  In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'
- With this porject we are trying to indentify key indicators which are leading or reasons for the loan default. 
- The dataset used contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
- 1 : Loans with High Interest Rate are Likely to Default
- 2 : Applicants either with 11 years of experience or less than 1 year of experience are high contributor to defaulters
- 3 : If Purpose of the loan is Debt Consolidation, Credit Card then its likely to default
- 4 : Bank Verification process need to revisited. Though the cases are verified by bank they are the high contributor to Default Loans
- 5 : Giving Maximum term to lower income application will reduce risk of Default
